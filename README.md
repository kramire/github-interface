# GitHub Interface

This application is an interface for visualizing GitHub repositories, and corresponding issues.

## Getting Started

### Prerequesities
* GitHub User API KKey

### Install & Start

1. Begin by forking this repository, and cloning locally. 

2. Install the necessary dependencies by running `npm i`.

3. Run `npm start` to start the React App.

4. Navgiate to `localhost:3000` in the browser.


## Next Steps

* Add additional breakpoints to improve responsiveness across devices.
* Add testing for UI / UX. (Current testing covers Redux functionality.)
* When there are no issues, display "No Issues" rather than have the column disappear.
* Add security around the local storage of the API Key.
